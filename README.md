# .gitignore-for-Xcode
A comprehensive .gitignore for Cocoa development on all Apple platforms (Mac OS X, iOS, TV, Watch)

We first shared this in 2009, and it's been wildly popular. 

The .gitignore file should prevent kruft from being checked into the Git repository.  It should
default to excluding files that normally don't belong in a repository. Your applicatin might 
be an exception in some way.  For example, you might want to include a database template in the 
application install. 

The .gitignore file should prevent even unlikely kruft, such as backup files from tools that you 
don't use, because someone else on your team might use them.

Share and enjoy! 

If you have suggestions for improvements, let us know or send a pull request.  

Kind regards,
